## HAP expensive  
``The per-person cost of averting homelessness through financial assistance is estimated as $10,300 and would be much less with better targeting of benefits to lower-income callers. The estimated benefits, not including many health benefits, exceed $20,000''~\cite{evans2016impact}.
## Focus on minimizing FNs
``The team considered false negatives to be more harmful than false positives and therefore throughout the study, the goal was to train a proficient model that primarily minimized false negatives, while balancing a desired decrease in false positives.''~\cite{vanberlo2021interpretable}
``While  additional  services  rarely  will  create  hardship  for the  recipient,  misallocating  limited  resources  can  have  serious  consequences for constrained shelter providers. More concerning, then, are false negatives, which  would  mean  that  those  most  at-risk  are  left  unsupported.  Given  the potential  impact  of  this  type  of  oversight,  we  evaluate  and  tune  our  models to maximize recall or sensitivity, thereby reducing the potential false negative rate.  The  trade-off  here,  however,  is  an increase  in  the  false  positive  rate.''~\cite{hong2018applications}

### Manuscript Specifications
* All text in one .tex file
* No graphics in manuscript submission
* Figures: uploaded separately
* Figures: Use Fig instead of Figure
* Tables: NO spacing/line breaks within cells to alter layout or alignment
* Tables: do not nest tabular environments (no tabular environments within tabular environments)
* Tables: no graphics or colored text (cell background color/shading OK)
* Tables: For tables that exceed the width of the text column, use the adjustwidth environment
