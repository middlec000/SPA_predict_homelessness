# Changes to Paper
## General
### Which metrics and at what threshold to report?
* Default is 0.5, but might not be most favorable
* Report all metrics listed in all other relevant studies to make comparable?
### How to compare to other studies? 
Study 1 below uses cutoff threshold of 0.5 (the default threshold) to record metrics, but our model may compare more favorably if we use a different threshold.
