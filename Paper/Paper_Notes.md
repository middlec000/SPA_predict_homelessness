# Questions/Notes for Dr. Oster
Emailed with Dr. Dan Li and she said standard model reporting is not done, just that studies typically report accuracy, precision (PPV), recall (TPR), F1-score, and the ROC Curve.

Only used PIT counts for general homelessness numbers, not for prediction. Used CMIS data for prediction (not homelessness numbers). CMIS data is better for us because they track people (name, last address, etc.), but is likely less complete than the PIT counts (collect counts from shelters and walk around and count unsheltered).  

Did not directly look at variance of predicted risk level before taking maximum for each person, but I did try to use mean predicted risk instead of maximum - much worse performance. Perhaps taking mean of 3 highest predicted risks (or similar) would be a good approach. I'd rather not investigate this now, though.  

Reason for not using Cox Regression. I think you are right about our Logistic Regression + taking maximum over time and Cox Time Varying Covariates being essentially equivalent. I'm hesitant to say they are mathematically equivalent, but they do perform the same functionality. I updated this in the Discussion -> Dependence on Time subsection.  

In response to Discussion -> Data Limitations: "I wonder if a high proportion of those identified had both City and Avista bills (was there bias?)."   
I did not look at this. Theoretically if the City and Avista bill amounts owed are kept separate, the model can get more information out of them, but I compared model performance and it is essentially the same. The nice thing about the aggregated version is that it is more generic so places where utilities are combined could still use this same model.  

I think we should leave model performance in the Abstract - other papers do this.
