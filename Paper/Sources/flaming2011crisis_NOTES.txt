Crisis Indicator: Triage Tool for Identifying Homeless Adults in Crisis

identifies homeless individuals in hospitals and jails

goal: identify most expensive 10%
"This group accounts for well over half of all public costs for homeless 
adults, and their costs decrease by 86 percent when they live in permanent supportive housing."

data
    demographic characteristics, medical diagnoses, and use of hospital and jail facilities

    2,907 sample records

"The most powerful components of the model are the number of days spent in hospitals as an inpatient or in jail mental health facilities as an inmate.  Health conditions have a tipping effect in the model, some disorders increase and others diminish the likelihood that an individual is in the 10th decile."

logistic regression

Performance
    FNR = 0.22 (referred to as shortfall)
    FPR = 0.27 (referred to as burden)

plotted FNR, FPR at different thresholds and chose where they intersect as useful threshold

best practice to use tiered need triaging: identify all at risk - identify medium risk, identify high risk
