Goal: prevention

Data
    "...11,105 families with incomes less than 200% of the federal poverty level26 who applied for Home-Base prevention services from the New York City Department of Homeless Services between October 1, 2004, and June 30, 2008."

    Predictors
        Demographics
        education level
        housing conditions
        disability
        criminal justice record
        childhood experiences (adolescent mother, adversity index)
        shelter history
    Outcome
        shelter entry

Model Performance
    prior contact model (info from prior contact with shelter system)
        tpr = 0.255, fpr = 0.114
    eviction model
        tpr = 0.674, fpr = 0.574
    worker model (workers deciding risk level)
        tpr = 0.716, fpr = 0.657
    screening model (points-based system using pruned regression parameters)
        tpr = 0.919, fpr = 0.657 (cutoff = 5 points)
        tpr = 0.747, fpr = 0.366 (cutoff = 7 points)
    full model (cox regression)
        tpr: 0.90
        fpr: 0.61 (eyeball from ROC + grid)

there have been homelessness prevention programs for a while
    increased dramatically since 2009
    those programs may not be very effective

need effective
    prevent homelessness
and efficient
    only target those who need help

filled in missing data using Stata's imputation by chained equations multiple imputation program

Cox regression

important attributes
    young age
    being pregnant or having a child aged younger than 2 years 
    facing an eviction threat
    frequent moves in the past year
    not holding a lease
    childhood adversity or disruptions
    current protective services involvement
    shelter history
        strong predictor

unimportant attributes
    self-reported poor building conditions
    adolescent motherhood
    indicators for mental illness
    substance abuse
    health problems
    history of criminal justice involvement

even very high-risk individuals still avoid becoming homeless

risk cutoff based on many factors

better data?
    income
        had none
    better info on crowding
        had only binary - want levels
    better info on rent subsidies
        only included if recorded as income - want all
    
    many characteristics self reported - may not be accurate
        substance abuse, domestic violence, etc.

models better than worker judgement

NYC using model, with workers allowed to override it
    allows for changing circumstances

    models likely will depend specific population
