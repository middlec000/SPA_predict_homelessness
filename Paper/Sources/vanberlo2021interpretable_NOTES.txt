Data Scope
    6521 individuals
    City of London's (Canada) Homeless Individuals and Families Information System1 (HIFIS)

Goal
    forecast chronic homelessness 6 months into the client’s future

Introduction
    Problem
        chronic homelessness in Canada is increasing while overall homelessness is decreasing
    Goals
        minimize false negatives
        create open-source, interpretable ML model
    Precedent Research
        Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool [4]
            study found shortcomings [5]
        Cox Regression in NYC [6]
        NYC study predict chances of readmission to shelters and length of stay [7]
            K-Means to cluster into: chronic, episodic, and transitional
        Cox regression [8]
        The Economic Roundtable log regression to identify top 10% [9]
            Silicon Valley Triage Tool [10]
            workers, young adults [11]
        first time, return to homelessness in LA [12]
        
    Our Contribution
        using ML
        both static and time-varying features
        post-hoc interpretability method
Methods
    Data
        4 years of 6521 clients’ records
        anonymous
        chronically homeless if at least 180 stays over the most recent 365.25 days
        typical data transformations: z-score, one-hot encoding
        used shelter data: income, medical, etc.
    Model
        RNN for dynamic (time-varying) data, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for static features
            end-to-end trainable
        output node had sigmoid activation
            threshold at 0.5
        equations for Performance metrics

        Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) used to increase interpretability
            approximate nonlinear model with linear model
Results
    fp's preferred over fn's [26]

    Interoperability
        "These findings corroborate Shinn et al.’s result that previous shelter stays were the strongest predictive feature for familial homelessness"
        "administration of a SPDAT screening questionnaire 1 time step ago is highly predictive of chronic homelessness (i.e. "(-1)30-Day_SPDAT"), perhaps commending London case workers’ ability to identify high-risk clients weeks prior to transitioning to chronic homelessness as defined here."
        aggregate days of receipt of housing subsidies
            lack of receipt of housing subsidies steers the the model towards predicting chronic homelessness
        advanced age
Discussion
    only compared findings to similar studies
    reported as deicamls, not percents
    "Sleeping rough, couch surfing, and stays in healthcare institutions were not accounted for in the calculation of the ground truth."
