expense rises as people remain homeless for longer

"Individuals will have far less social, economic, legal, and medical
damage in their lives, making it more feasible and less costly to help
them become stably housed."

"Historic pictures are used to illustrate this report. These pictures make two points. First, homelessness is not new in Los Angeles, what is new is the number of people living without shelter. Second, we have responded successfully to homelessness in the past by providing housing and jobs."
