Data
5,050,639 individuals aged 11 years and older
Massachusetts state databases
2011â€“2015
homelessness 0.82%

Model
logistic regression
94 predictors

Performance
AUC: 94.0
balanced accuracy: 86.4
tpr: 77.8 (sensitivity)
tnr: 95.1 (specificity)
ppv: 11.7
npv: 99.8

Additional
Strong association between predicted homelessness and fatal opioid overdose: "...predicted homeless status was associated with a nearly
23-fold increase in the risk of fatal opioid overdose."

integrating data from multiple state databases is new

Nice organization
Abstract
Introduction
Methods
    Data and sample

    Measures
        measures of homelessness
        independent variables
            did not worry about multicollinearity
            Table 1. summary of datasets and variables used
        fatal opioid overdoses
    
    Analysis
        stratified random sampling based on outcome (75%, 25%)
        undersampling
        for model analysis used threshold of 0.5

        when analyzing relationship between homelessness and fatal opioid overdose, labeled people either predicted homeless or known to be homeless as homeless (seems weird)

Results
    Observed homelessness
        how many P, which data sources they came from
    Homelessness classification
        model performance
        both table and paragraph reporting of metrics
        used 0.5 as threshold (but this is arbitrary we should compare based on one of their metrics)
        compare PPV to chance
        1 True positive: # False positives
    Fatal opioid overdoses

Discussion
    limitations at the end
        compare homelessness rate in data to estimated homelessness rate based on PIT counts
        cross-sectional study - some predictors may have come after homelessness was experienced

Conclusions
    identifying homeless persons can help services better coordinate their care
    opportunities for future work
